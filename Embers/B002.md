## Why

- RMM tools provide detection evasion, particularly in environments where IT departments use RMM tools for business purposes. 
- 70% increase in adversary use of RMM tools.  
- AnyDesk normally writes a file named "gcapi.dll"; files with other names may be malicious.
- AnyDesk is typically installed to C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe by default; other locations may be malicious.
- AnyDesk cli instalers (exe and MSI versions) run with the --install flag; adversaries typically install AnyDesk with the --silent flag.
