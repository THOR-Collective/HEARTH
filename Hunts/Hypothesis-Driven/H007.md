| H007    | After compromising a host, adversaries may attempt to execute malicious commands to complete additional tasks. | Execution | Adversaries often abuse legitimate command interpreters/applications, such as CMD, PowerShell, or bash/zsh. | #execution #sus | [Jamie Williams](https://x.com/jamieantisocial) |

## Why

- Adversaries often abuse accessible terminal/shell applications to execute post-compromise tasks
- Malicious command execution may be identifiable by characteristics of the:
  - command -- adversaries/malware typically execute very common and [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) commands that may also be rare for your environment, such as:
      - `whomai`
      - `ipconfig /all`
      - `nltest /domain_trusts`
      - `net localgroup administrators`
      - `net group "Domain Computers" /domain`
      - `systeminfo`
      - `route print`
      - `net view /all`
      - `net config workstation`

  - attempts to obfuscate executed commands ([T1027.010 - Obfuscated Files or Information: Command Obfuscation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/010/)
      - [M005](https://github.com/jwillyamz/THOR/blob/main/Hunts/Model-Assisted/M005.md) addresses this
  - user/host (e.g., does`{person}` in `{department}` ever execute admin commands like this?)
  - command/process lineage (e.g., why are `PowerShell.exe` processes spawning from Outlook...?)

- Malicious commands may also be executed from script files or [common admin tools](https://github.com/BushidoUK/Ransomware-Tool-Matrix/blob/main/Tools/DiscoveryEnum.md), so consider also investigating newly created files ([T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/)) referenced in suspicious commands
- **Note:** Consider baselining and comparing instances of suspicious command execution against known false positives (e.g., [WTFBins](https://wtfbins.wtf/))
