An adversary is moving laterally within a compromised network using legitimate remote services.

| H006     | After compromising an initial asset, an adversary may attempt to pivot to access additional resources within a victim network. | Lateral Movement | Adversaries often abuse legitimate remote access features (such as RDP and SSH) already enabled in the environment. | #lateralmovement #sus | [Jamie Williams](https://x.com/jamieantisocial) |

## Why

- Adversaries may seek access beyond the initially compromised asset (i.e., to steal additional data, deploy ransomware, etc.)
- Legitimate remote access features may be abused by adversaries, and may also extend between network boundaries (i.e., on-prem to cloud)
    - Commonly abused remote protocols include:
        - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), destination port `3389` ([T1021.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/))
        - Server Message Block (SMB), destination ports `139` or `445` ([T1021.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002/))
        - Secure Shell (SSH), destination port `22` ([T1021.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004/))
        - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), destination ports `135` or `5985`/`5986` ([T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/))
- Abuse of these features is often leveraging legitimate user credentials ([T1078 - Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)), so tracing the activity of known-compromised accounts may also highlight potential lateral movement activity
- Analyzing adversary enumeration commands may also shed light on potential lateral movement activity (i.e., what assets did the adversary discover during [T1018 - Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/)?)
