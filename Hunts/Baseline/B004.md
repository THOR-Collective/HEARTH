# B004
The existence of unexpected or other anomalous accounts may indicate that an adversary has established persistence by creating malicious new users.

## Why

- Adversary-created and controlled accounts may provide a persistent backdoor to compromised assets
- Accounts may be created on various types of assets - including desktops, servers, AD/domain services ([H008](https://github.com/jwillyamz/THOR/blob/main/Hunts/Hypothesis-Driven/H008.md)), cloud applications/environments, and edge devices
- **Note:** Adversaries may also attempt to hide ([T1564.002 - Hide Artifacts: Hidden Users](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/002/)) or otherwise conceal created accounts. Very commonly, malicious accounts will try to mimic common naming conventions, or even match those of the victim environment ([T1036 - Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/))
